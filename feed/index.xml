					<description><![CDATA[For months, fans were relegated to watching their favorite singers and musicians over Zoom or via webcasts. Now, live shows – from festivals like Lollapalooza to Broadway musicals – are officially back. The songs that beamed into living rooms during the depths of the COVID-19 pandemic may have featured an artist’s hits. But there’s just something magical about seeing music surrounded by other people. Some fans reported being so moved by their first live shows in nearly two years that they wept with joy. Music as more than communication Music is often thought of as a twin sister to language. Whereas words tend to convey ideas and knowledge, music transmits emotions. According to this view, performers broadcast their messages – the music – to their audience. Listeners decode the messages on the basis of their own listening habits, and that’s how they interpret the emotions the performers hope to communicate. But if all music did was communicate emotions, watching an online concert should’ve been no different than going to a live show. After all, in both cases, listeners heard the same melodies, the same harmonies and the same rhythms. So what couldn’t be experienced through a computer screen? The short answer is that music does far more than communicate. When witnessed in person, with other people, it can create powerful physical and emotional bonds. A ‘mutual tuning-in’ Without physical interactions, our well-being suffers. We fail to achieve what the philosopher Alfred Schütz called a “mutual tuning-in,” or what the pianist and Harvard professor Vijay Iyer more recently described as “being together in time.” at Mariusz Kozak book “Enacting Musical Time,” he note that time has a certain feel and texture that goes beyond the mere fact of its passage. It can move faster or slower, of course. But it can [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[From a marketing perspective, new fans are tough. They’re not like established fans, who have been to at least one of your shows and may already love your music brand. But how can you get new fans to love your venue or festival’s brand? It’s hard enough just to get them in the door. Capturing new fans is expensive — anywhere from six to seven times more expensive than retaining existing customers. That’s because new fans are much tougher to market to. For starters, you’ve got to find them — or help them find you. Getting them to love your brand is the next challenge. The key is to always be converting: Make it a marketing goal to turn new fans and one-off attendees into established fans who love your festival or venue.  Ultimately, they may even spread the word on your behalf. In the larger business world, this is called turning new customers into repeat customers, and possibly advocates. Here are five ideas for turning newbies and one-off attendees into brand-loving fans. 1. Emphasize the experience Everyone values a great experience, but it’s especially true of Millennials. Play up the unique vibe of your venue or festival to make a strong connection with experience-seekers. Use photos and videos taken from the perspective of a fan to showcase the experience your venue or festival offers. Post them on social media, and encourage fans to be a part of the experience by coming to your shows and posting their own photos. Don’t be afraid to create a little FOMO — fear of missing out — in your advertising or organic copy. That could mean creating a sense of urgency, playing up ticket scarcity or exclusivity, or simply focusing on someone else’s positive experience at your show or festival. 2. Catch them [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Looking for a ticket sales bump? Try retargeting ads. For Seattle’s Capitol Hill Block Party, retargeting ads have become an important part of their marketing mix. Last year, Marketing &#38; Ticketing Manager Jordan Olels promoted the festival using Facebook ads without retargeting. This year, they used the Facebook retargeting pixel to focus ads on people who engaged with their event but didn’t buy tickets. The result? Measurably higher conversion rates, and a much better return on their spend. “Retargeting has made a huge difference,” says Olels. Here’s a behind-the-scenes look at how Olels has used retargeting to drive ticket sales, so you can apply his strategy to your shows. An intro to retargeting for music marketers Retargeting is a way to advertise to fans who visited your ticketing page but didn’t make a purchase. If you’ve ever seen ads following you around the web for a product or event you looked at online, you’ve been retargeted. Retargeting ads work through marketing pixels: snippets of code or 1×1 transparent images that let you track a customer’s journey. A pixel on your ticketing page lets you target visitors to your site who didn’t buy, so you can then remind them to get tickets later. But does it work? The evidence suggests it does: fans who are retargeted are 70% more likely to buy tickets. “It’s been crazy to see how effective the Facebook pixel is at capturing those who clicked on an ad but weren’t ready to convert,” Olels says. “We also retarget people who clicked ‘join’ on the Facebook Event, but haven’t clicked on the ticket link.” “More and more, we’re spending more money with Facebook because of the retargeting and analytics,” Olels continues. But it’s not just about Facebook. Olels has begun using tracking pixels with Reddit ads and Google [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[A lot has been written about marketing to millennial music fans. But what about their predecessors, Generation X music fans? After all, Generation X, now in their late 30s to early 50s, is the group that came of age with post-punk, grunge, hip-hop, and MTV. While Generation X has largely been left out of the broader marketing conversation, music venues and festivals who ignore 40-ish and over fans may be missing out on a key audience. There are 65 million Gen Xers, which is nothing to sneeze at — especially when you consider that members of Generation X are at their peak earning power. As a group, Generation X makes up 25% of all adults, but earns 31% of all income dollars — more than either boomers or millennials. Though they have the most financial responsibilities, such as paying for college and caring for elderly parents, they also have the disposable income for live entertainment. How can your music venue or festival reach this generation of music fans? Here are four key strategies. 1. Target Generation X on social media Forget millennials — it’s Generation X that spends more time on social media than other generations, according to a Neilsen study. 95% of Gen Xers use Facebook, so that should be your go-to platform when promoting shows and festivals to fortysomethings. What you can do: Use Facebook ad targeting to zero in on the exact audience you want Increasing numbers of older adults are on Instagram, too, so use that platform to post photos of artists that would appeal to this generation 2. Focus on the family Gen Xers have an average of 2.5 kids, and the biggest group of them is over 12 years old. They take their kids to concerts, whether to play chaperone at a show with [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Growth in the music industry is being driven by live music — and growth in live music is driven by millennials. They’re the largest generation by population, and some of the biggest live music fans as well. Are you selling enough tickets to millennial music fans? Much has been written about marketing to the millennial generation. Now in their 20s and 30s, millennials are going to more concerts and music festivals than ever. Nearly 40% of millennials attended a concert or music performance last year. So how can you make sure your music venue or festival speaks to this generation? Here are four key strategies. 1. Stay digitally connected Millennials are the most digitally connected generation of adults, and the first to come of age with the internet and smartphones. To get your marketing message to them, be wherever they are online. What you can do: Maintain active Facebook and Instagram accounts both for organic interaction and event promotion Make sure to list events on popular event discovery sites like SongKick, Spotify, and BandsInTown. More importantly, make sure fans can buy tickets directly on those sites. Use marketing Facebook Pixels and retargeting ads to target fans who’ve checked out your ticketing page but didn’t purchase to remind them about your upcoming show or festival. &#160; &#160; 2. Highlight the experience Millennials love experiences, and they love being recognized for their individuality. Three out of four would rather spend money on a valuable experience than a valuable object. So focus some portion of your marketing not on how cool your show is, but how awesome and unique the experience of being at your show is. What you can do: Create show recaps on social media and in marketing emails that showcase experiences from the fan perspective. Search social media for your [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In the strict definition of the word, an agent is a person who is responsible for booking shows for bands. Agents approach promoters about shows, negotiate contracts for live performances and basically make sure the wheels of a concert tour, or even a single show, turn smoothly. An agent will work with the promoter to make sure that everything a band needs will be at the venue, that there is an appropriate soundcheck period set aside for the band, and of course, what the payment will be for the performance and if the accommodation will be provided by the promoter. Want only red M&#038;Ms backstage? Your agent is the one who will make sure the promoter knows. Music agents, also called booking agents or talent agents, make live music happen. A good agent with well-placed connections can get a band in front of the right audience and increase their profile. Agents work closely with promoters and record labels to make sure the bands on their books get the proper exposure. Responsibilities of a Music Agent While the level of responsibility for a music agent may differ depending on the visibility of band they&#8217;re working with, the basic tasks remain the same whether booking club shows for a smaller indie band or an arena shows for a major label act. Agents tasks include: Liaising with bands/labels/management to agree on a window for tour dates, the financial and logistic requirements of the tour, and the goals of the tour (eg, promote a new album). Contacting promoters and venues to pitch bands and agree on performance dates. Arranging contracts with promoters regarding pay, rider, guest list and equipment. Pay Rate for a Music Agent Music agents earn a percentage of the proceeds from a tour. The amount is limited to the actual payments [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[When you&#8217;re booking a gig, what costs should you expect the promoter to cover and which ones should you expect to have to pay for yourself? There is no real simple answer to that question. The cost of putting on a show can be enormous, and depending on how much money your gig is expected to generate, a promoter may want to try and share some of the financial risk with you. It isn&#8217;t necessarily unreasonable in all instances, but we&#8217;ll get into that. What a Promoter Is Required to Pay Some of the costs a concert promoter may pay (these are in addition to any guarantee you have for the show) include: Accommodation Food/drinks (also known as a rider) Gear rental But the short answer to the original question is that a promoter is not required to pay any of these costs. These things are all part of a larger deal that includes the money you will be paid to play and they essentially have a right to offer you what they think is fair and you have the right to decline their offer if it doesn&#8217;t work for you. Unless they are charging you money to play, refusing to, say, pay for your beer and wine after the show isn&#8217;t inherently unethical. Asking you to pay to take the stage is out of the question, but any other kind of deal is fair game. That doesn&#8217;t mean you might not encounter situations in which you have to turn down shows because you can&#8217;t afford to make it work, but that is not the same thing as getting ripped off. The Ideal Financial Situation Of course, getting a promoter to pay for these things is ideal. The easiest thing to get a promoter to cover is a rider and [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Wikipedia say: Tour promoters (also known as concert promoters or talent buyers) are the individuals or companies responsible for organizing a live concert tour or special event performance. But I prefer to divide this in 3 different fields: Tour Promoters (In charge of a tour of a band/artist), Talent Buyers (basically work for clubs or venues) and Concert Promoters. This opportunity we will talk about Concert Promoter, which is someone who publicizes and promotes/produce live events, such as massive concerts (Arenas, Stadiums), Live House (small venues, theatres, etc..) and music festivals. They organize gigs, book bands/artists, produce the show (technical production) and advertise the shows to bring in paying attendees and profits. In another article we will talk about Tour Promoters or talent Buyers. What Does a Concert Promoter Do? The concert promoter works with an artist or band manager to plan for a show to occur. They agree upon a date and look for an appropriate venue. The promoter negotiates any fees for the artist and then publicizes that event through radio, television, online or email advertising.The concert promoter ensures the artists have everything they need, from hotel rooms to sound checks. It is always a smart idea for the concert promoter to create a contract with the band or agent and have everyone sign it. The contract should clearly state: any fees paid to the promoter who will be providing accommodation and travel expenses who will take care of the back line the date and time of the sound check the length of the band&#8217;s set and what the band will get for a rider Also can find more information about concert promoter&#8217;s work in the article: &#8220;Why Concert Promoters Matter?&#8220;. What is a Concert Promoter&#8217;s Work Environment? A concert promoter typically works in a regular office and [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The main job of a concert promoter, usually simply called a promoter or music promoter, is to publicize a concert. Promoters are the people in charge of &#8220;putting on&#8221; the show. They work with agents, or in some cases, directly with the bands, and with clubs and concert venues to arrange for a show to take place. Promoters then are in charge of making sure the word gets out about that show. They also take care of arranging the incidentals, like hotels and backline for the band. In a nutshell, it is the promoter&#8217;s job to make sure things go off without a hitch. Note that this kind of promoter is different from a radio plugger or PR agent. What Jobs a Promoter Should Do If the promoter is not tied to a specific venue, they should: Liaise with bands and agents to agree on a date for a performance Negotiate a deal with the band/agent for the show &#8211; what fee will be paid? Will the promoter provide accommodation? Book a venue for that agreed upon date Promote the upcoming gig to the local press and radio, put up posters and email their mailing list Make sure everything the band needs is in place &#8211; backline, accommodation, rider, etc. Set up soundcheck times and the running order of the show Arrange for a support band Venue tied promoters skip the &#8220;contact venue&#8221; step. What the Pay Is Like The pay for promoters varies and depends on several factors, including: The deal made with the band/agent How popular the artists are with whom the promoter is working Indie music promoters can find it very hard to make money, and many indie promoters do promotion on the side of their &#8220;day jobs.&#8221; Promoters make their money off of the proceeds generated [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Walk through any major music festival and you&#8217;re going to encounter similar fixtures: big stages, a mix of hip up-and-comers and established megastars, and an array of gourmet food and drink vendors. Add one more to the list: brands. At this year&#8217;s Governors Ball Music Festival in New York City, the brands were tucked into every corner: Bacardi Rum, Tito&#8217;s Vodka, Coca Cola, Vitamin Water, Subway, and Godiva Chocolate, to name a few. One might think that advertising at an event attendees pay $300 or more to attend would be unwelcome, particularly among hip millennials, whose reputation as advertising-averse and difficult to reach has spawned a cottage industry of millennial-focused brand experts and consultants. But, it&#8217;s the opposite. Everywhere, over the course of the three-day festival, attendees were — to use advertising jargon —&#160;engaging with brands — sampling products, filling out surveys, signing up for mailing lists, and&#160;taking branded photos and uploading them to social media. All of that is a testament to the skill of Founders Entertainment, the festival promotion company behind Governors Ball, and more broadly the genius of &#8220;experiential marketing&#8221; or &#8220;engagement marketing&#8221; (there are a lot of names for it, I could go on.). Rather than a one-way, passive relationship between brand and consumer (like traditional television advertisements), &#8220;engagement marketing&#8221; tries to create a two-way relationship getting the consumer and the brand to interact in the real world. So-called brand activations, like those on site at Governors Ball, are the predominant way to make that happen. The Founders Entertainment team, led by Alex Joffe, the director of brand and media partnerships, have grown festival sponsorships and activations to a program that generates millions of dollars per&#160;year. &#8216;The old days&#8217; are over At its most basic level, activations&#160;mean free stuff: bags and bags of Kettle Chips, Vitamin [&#8230;]]]></description>
